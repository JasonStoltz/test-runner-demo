## About

### Structure
This app contains the following directory structure:
```
src/
  components/ <-- React components should go here, categorized by feature
  model/ <-- This should contain the core data model and include behaviors for fetching, updating, and retrieving that data from a store
  lib/ <-- custom libraries not sources from an npm repository
  store / <-- This should be a collection of reducers and stores that represent the application's core state atom. Data model state and application state should be kept in separate reducers

```
